        <Description>A true warden understands that mounted warfare is
as natural as fighting among the glorious Lion infantry.
When Mounted, you gain a bonus of +1k0 to all Bugei
Skill Rolls. Additionally, when spending a Void Point to
augment a Horsemanship or Investigation Skill Roll, you
gain a bonus of +2k2 instead of +1k1.

        <Description>The Lioness Legion is feared for many reasons, but the greatest
among them is their fleetness on the field of battle. When in
the Full Attack Stance, any movement you make during the
course of the Round gains an additional 5 feet (this benefit
is only gained once per Round). Additionally, as a Complex
Move Action, you may move your Water Ring x25 feet.
