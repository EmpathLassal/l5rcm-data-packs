        <Description>Although not as talented as the inhuman
minions of the Shadow Dragon or the Lying
Darkness, the Daigotsu scouts are still highly
skilled in moving about without being detected.
Stealth is now considered a School Skill for you, and
you gain one additional Emphasis in the skill above any
you may already possess, and in excess of the maximum
normal number of Emphases you may posses. Your Move
Actions are not reduced when using Stealth, and when
using Stealth you may also ignore any terrain penalties
that would normally reduce your Move Actions.

        <Description>Even the most devout member of the Brotherhood of
Shinsei would attest that there is no one true path to
enlightenment, and certain members of the Order of the
Spider seem to bear out that theory. You gain two Kiho, for
which you must meet all normal prerequisites. These Kiho
do not count against the normal number of Kiho you may
learn as determined by your School Rank.
