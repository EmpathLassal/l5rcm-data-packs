        <Description>A Mirumoto Sentinel is intimately familiar with the land he
is tasked with patrolling, and can use its every resource to
his advantage. When you are in a province for which you
possess the Way of the Land Advantage, you may select
any three Bugei Skills you possess. While in the selected
province, you gain a bonus of +1k0 to Skill
Rolls using those Skills. You may select different
Skills for each province for which you possess
the Way of the Land Advantage. Additionally,
you may make a Contested Void Roll against one
opponent at the beginning of a skirmish, before
Initiative is rolled. That opponent’s Water Ring
is considered one rank lower for the purpose
of determining Move Action distances for the
remainder of the skirmish.

        <Description>Water Hammer City, and the path of the smith has been
made open to you. You may spend a Void Point to add
double your Water Ring to the total of all Craft Skills you
make for the rest of the day. If you are a shugenja, you
may instead pay this cost by spending a Water spell slot.
You may only benefit from a single use of this Technique
at a time (i.e. you cannot spent two Void Points at different
times during the day and gain two bonuses equal to three
times your Void Point).
