        <Description>The ferocity of the Crane spearmen is well known upon the
battlefield, as is their ability to pin and immobilize those
who would threaten the clan. When using a spear to attack
an opponent, if you strike an opponent who has not yet
acted this round, he must make two Raises to successfully
attack you for the remainder of this Round.

        <Description>A warrior-poet understands that focus is the one and only
key to not only victory, but enlightenment as well. When
you spend a Void Point to augment an Iaijutsu Skill Roll or a
Perform: Poetry Skill Roll, you gain a bonus of +2k1 instead
of +1k1. Additionally, whenever you are victorious in a duel
or a poetry contest, you gain one additional point of Glory. If
you were championing someone else, that person also gains
one additional point of Glory. This is in addition to any normal
amount being rewarded.
