      <Tech name="I Am A Weapon" rank="4" id="scorpion_i_am_a_weapon">
        <Description>A true weaponmaster understands the common thread
between all weapons, and draws upon it. When wielding
any melee weapon, a number of times per skirmish equal
to your school rank, you may as a Free Action use any
other melee Weapon Skill you possess for attack rolls
using your current weapon. For example, you could spend
a Void Point to use Kenjutsu when wielding a tetsubo if
you had no ranks in Heavy Weapons. You gain no benefits
from any Mastery Abilities or Emphases when utilizing
this Technique. The effect lasts a number of Rounds equal
to your School Rank, and while this Technique is in effect
you may make melee attacks as a Simple Action rather
than a Complex Action.
